# IMDbMovieDataFiller
This code updates an existing Excel file with movie-related data such as rating, runtime, duration, director, and more. It uses `pandas` to handle the Excel file and `imdbpy` to fetch data from IMDb. The script searches for each movie name in the Excel file, retrieves the details from IMDb, and fills in the corresponding information.
